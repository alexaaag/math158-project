# math158-project
This is a class project for MATH158 Statistical Linear Models at Pomona College.

In this project, we will mainly focus on: how can we predict a pokemon's combat power after evolution based on their previous combat features? 

The dataset we are using to build our model is an original data set collected by OpenIntro. The dataset contains 75 observations across 26 variables, with each observation representing a randomly generated Pokemon that the gamer caught. Four species are represented in this data, so the conclusions drawn from this modeling process can only be inferred onto the population of these 4 particular species: Eevee, Pidgey, Caterpie, and Weedle. 

You should be able to see our project part I: descriptive analysis, part II: Simple Linear Regression, part III: Multiple Linear Regression, and part IV: Applying Principal Component Analysis and Summary Graph. 

Go to the final write-up for a high level analysis and really cool visualization :)
