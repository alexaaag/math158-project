# math158-project
This is a class project for MATH158 Statistical Linear Models at Pomona College.

In this project, we focus on: what linear models we could use to best predict a pokemon's combat power after evolution based on their previous combat features? 

You should be able to see our project part I: descriptive analysis, part II: Simple Linear Regression, part III: Multiple Linear Regression, and Final: Ridge, LASSO, Principal Component Analysis and Summary Graph. 

Go to the final write-up for a high level analysis and really cool visualization :)
